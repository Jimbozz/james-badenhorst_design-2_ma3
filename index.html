          <h2>About us</h2>
          <p>
            Ever since its beginning Homeland has always strived to create
            valuable relationships between ourselves and our suppliers. We have
            helped our suppliers become as sustainable as possible by joining
            into partnerships with both the suppliers and farmers allowing us to
            have far less of an impact on the environment. As well as making
            sure the quality of our products are of superior quality.

              <p>
                For us, there is nothing more important than seating which does
                not only feel great but can also be great for your posture too.
                Thus we have worked with our team and created a range of seating
                with our suppliers which tackles that issue. We're sure your
                going to love it.
